# PyMusicPlayer
A music player I created using tkinter in Python.

Run this script by opening your terminal and typing::

  git clone https://github.com/sketchyboi14/PyMusicPlayer.git
  cd PyMusicPlayer
  python3 PyMusicPlayer
  
If you'd like to install this onto your device type::

  python setup.py install
  or
  pip install -e PyMusicPlayer
  python -m PyMusicPlayer
