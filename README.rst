PyMusicPlayer
A music player I created using tkinter in Python.

Run this script by opening your terminal and typing::

  git clone https://github.com/sketchyboi14/PyMusicPlayer.git
  cd PyMusicPlayer
  python3 PyMusicPlayer
  
Install to Windows::

  python setup.py install
 
This will create a build folder. Click build, then exe-win32-3.8, then run PyMusicPlayer.exe
  
If you'd like to install the program using an msi installer, you can download it from the Releases section
